## Build interfaces using webcomponents with React-inspired syntax

1. **Scalable and reusable interfaces**: with Atomico the code is simpler and you can apply practices that facilitate the reuse of your code.
2. **Open communication**: with Atomico you can communicate states by events, properties or methods.
3. **Agnostic**: your custom element will work in any web-compatible library, eg React, Vue, Svelte or Angular.
4. **Performance**: Atomico has a comparative performance at Svelte levels, winning the third position in performance according to [webcomponents.dev](https://twitter.com/atomicojs/status/1391775734641745929) in a comparison of 55 libraries among which is React, Vue, Stencil and Lit.

### Atomico is simple and the result will always be a **standard and optimized webcomponent**.

## Summary

Atomico is a modern syntax micro-library created by Matias Trujillo alias [@UpperCod](https://github.com/uppercod), which simplifies the creation of webcomponents by replacing the need to use classes and contexts by functions and scope to support logic, attributes, properties, methods and events.
